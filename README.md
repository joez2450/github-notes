#### Git
Git is a piece of software that primarily exists for the version control of your work. Git keeps track of files, and it can also work properly when multiple people are collaborating on the same project. 

#### Github
Github is a web service that allows people to do things on a server and website. GitHub is mainly used for interactive coding and any individual projects. The web service also has Git behind its software, which allows people to version control their work.

#### Repo
Repo, or repository, is a place in GitHub where all of the files of a project are stored. A repo can be named (with a dash for spaces), set to a certain visibility (public or private), and include a description. There are many features of a repo. In a repo, there is an option to create new files, upload files, name files, and most importantly save changes to a work. 

#### Commit
Commit is a change. When the "commit file", or "commit change" in a repository on GitHub is clicked, the recent changes and actions in the file will be saved. For every commit, there is a specific hash that acts as an identifier. Commit also has an important feature. A description of your recent changes can be provided before committing the change itself. This is helpful for keeping track of your work, as there would be notes for changes. Additionally, this would also be helpful for version control, as it would be easier to see the changes in the history of a file.
